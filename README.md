Reflection

For my game, I created a space-themed platformer. I have a black background with stars in the background adding to the overall theme of the game. In my foreground layer, I added my player, who is an astronaut, and my wooden crates, which are the platforms. These crates represent cargo that has gone free into space. I used Piskel to create my pixel art due to ease of use, browser accessibility, and it was the best overall option available. I exported my images in the PNG format and then imported them into a Unity 3d core game. The only challenge I ran into was with my layers in Unity as that part of my game creation took the longest period.
